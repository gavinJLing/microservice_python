The colour, Sepang Blue, suits the R8 down to the ground and is the perfect balance between striking and remaining classy. Whilst it is subjective and is ultimately down to personal preference, chrome trim is not the thing to have anymore. Fortunately this has the Black Pack, so the front grills, exhaust tips and window bezels are in Gloss Black finish - far more desirable.Sitting proudly behind the glass engine cover, is the 517bhp 5.2 V10 engine, presented in a sea of stunning Carbon trims. The engine note and performance from this Powertrain is staggering and will bring a smile to the new owners face again and again.
