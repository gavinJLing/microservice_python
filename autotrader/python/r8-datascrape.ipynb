Rikon London is delighted to offer this 2017/66 Audi R8 V10 Plus for sale, presented in Daytona Grey over Black Leather w/ contrasting Rock Grey stitching. Registered new on the 28th of February 2017, this 2 owner V10+ presents in superb condition throughout. Since entering our Mayfair premises the exterior was treated to a 2-stage machine polish to bring out the wonderful pearl effect in the un-marked Daytona grey paint. Furthermore the sports seats show little wear and the whole interior is free from grease and stains. As a 'Plus' variant this R8 is 69hp up on the standard V10 and comes equipped as standard with carbon-ceramic brakes (£7k alone), Heated Bucket Seats and lashings of Carbon Fibre throughout. This example additionally benefits from a plethora of optional extra's listed below. V10 Plus Sport suspension is extremely uncomfortable, therefore the first owner specified the Variable Magnetic Ride. This was £1600 on its own, although the £3500 Sport Plus Pack was additionally ticked, which also includes the £1800 Sports Exhaust and £1200 Dynamic Steering. The supportive, yet comfy bucket seats are complimented by Bang & Olufsen sound and Extended Fine Nappa Leather, found in the Comfort and Sound Package. The £650 Driver Assistance Package adds cruise control to keep you legal and a reversing camera to save embarrassment, while the £100 83-litre fuel tank will cross continents faster thanks to fewer fuel stops. Servicing has been kept strictly with Audi Hatfield since new- the last visit was on the 10th of October 2019, having covered 11,572 miles. For extra peace of mind this V10 Plus is still covered by the remaining balance of it's 3-year manufactures warranty ending in February 2020.\n",
