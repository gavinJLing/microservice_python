The colour, Sepang Blue, suits the R8 down to the ground and is the perfect balance between striking and remaining classy.

The engine note and performance from this Powertrain is staggering and will bring a smile to the new owners face again and again.

The R8 is full of creature comforts, such as the Bang  Olufsen sound system, Cruise Control, Multi-function steering wheel, heated and fully electric seats, Air Conditioning, Automatic Headlights, Navigation Plus and because of the void where the engine would normally be a surprising amount of space for luggage.|Â£192 Admin Fee applies |If you have any questions about this beautiful R8 or would like to arrange a viewing, please call one of our team on 01689 660603, Â¿192 Admin Fee - HPI certificates, P/x Welcome, Warranty Included, Finance available, Â£57,977\n",

The supportive, yet comfy bucket seats are complimented by Bang & Olufsen sound and Extended Fine Nappa Leather, found in the Comfort and Sound Package.
