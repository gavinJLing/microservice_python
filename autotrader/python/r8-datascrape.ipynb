She has owned this car over 12 months and covered less than 2000 miles. By far the best color combination being black with black leather and also benefiting from the must have Carbon blades, Wheels have recently been professionally refurbished with all brand new Pirelli P Zero tyres. About 6 months ago i decided to get rid of the old and dated mag ride suspension and had a full set of brand new coilovers fitted that sit at standard ride height, The difference to the ride and stability of the car is amazing, Obviously these are fully adjustable if you ever wanted to lower the car but personally i think its low enough at standard, I had the car serviced 6 months ago and had everything changed including all new spark plugs, All filters, Oil and all new sump washers etc etc, Also this week I have had another oil service done for the new owners peace of mind, Everything works as it should and it runs and drives superb, It wants for nothing at all, Number plate will be removed from the vehicle prior to sale, Viewing is available at our home address at evenings and weekends and all test drives will be with me behind the wheel, Any questions please ask,  Kind regards Mike, Black, 5+ owners, £34,975\n",

The colour, Sepang Blue, suits the R8 down to the ground and is the perfect balance between striking and remaining classy.

Fortunately this has the Black Pack, so the front grills, exhaust tips and window bezels are in Gloss Black finish - far more desirable.Sitting proudly behind the glass engine cover, is the 517bhp 5.2 V10 engine, presented in a sea of stunning Carbon trims. The engine note and performance from this Powertrain is staggering and will bring a smile to the new owners face again and again.

The R8 is full of creature comforts, such as the Bang  Olufsen sound system, Cruise Control, Multi-function steering wheel, heated and fully electric seats, Air Conditioning, Automatic Headlights, Navigation Plus and because of the void where the engine would normally be a surprising amount of space for luggage.|£192 Admin Fee applies |If you have any questions about this beautiful R8 or would like to arrange a viewing, please call one of our team on 01689 660603, ¿192 Admin Fee - HPI certificates, P/x Welcome, Warranty Included, Finance available, £54,977\n",
