## Autotrader tools.

`audi_scraper.py` is the automated version of the Jupyter Notebook. Tool to scrape a  website and extract details of cars.
`r8-datascrape.ipynb` the Jupyter notebook instance I've used to hack together a python based screen scraper.
`data_server.py` a REST api to present scaped Audi R8 details to a web client SPA (vue.js) UI.

`car_science_autotrader_YYYYmmDD.json` same files created by the above scraper.
